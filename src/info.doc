🛍️ About This Marketplace

Welcome to your go-to free marketplace demo—a platform designed to simplify buying and selling between everyday users. Whether you’re listing a product you no longer need or browsing for that hidden gem someone else wants to pass on, we’ve made it intuitive and accessible.

You can:

• 🧾 Upload & List Products — Share what you’re selling in just a few clicks.
• 💬 Chat with Sellers or Buyers — Ask questions, confirm details, and negotiate before you commit.
• 🛒 Buy from Others — Discover items from fellow users and make purchases with confidence.


This version is a demo of what’s to come. 🚧 In the upcoming update, we’re adding powerful features like product deletion—but not just for anyone. Only the original uploader will have the authority to remove their listed items, ensuring secure and fair control. 🔐

To manage authentication while it’s still in development, all listed products will automatically disappear after 30 days. This keeps the platform tidy and protects users as we fine-tune those account-based permissions.
